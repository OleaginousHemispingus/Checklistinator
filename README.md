# Checklistinator
A python script that finds the locations at which bird species are most likely to occur/co-occur.

The script takes in a list of species, a location, and a start and end date. If more than 2 species are selected, you can also choose to 'match' a number of species (that is, you input 8 species and then say 'match 4 out of the 8.'
